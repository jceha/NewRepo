# About
I will start a **Ph.D.** in the David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science at the University of Waterloo in the Fall of 2017. I'll be working in the Human-Computer Interaction Lab with Dr. Edith Law. 

I graduated with an **M.Sc.** in Human-Machine Communication _cum laude_ from the Univeristy of Groningen (Dept. of Artificial Intelligence). Alongside the normal master, I completed the Honours Master 'High Tech Systems and Materials' for which I interned at Philips Consumer Lifestyle in Drachten, the Netherlands, and completed a number of masterclasses and personal development workshops.

I have a **B.Sc.** in Cognitive Systems: Cognition and Brain from the University of British Columbia. 



# Research
## Summary
My main interests lie in the advancement of the neuroscience and human-machine interaction fields. I am intruiged by cognition and by increasing our understanding of it I would like to apply the knowledge to improve the communcation between humans and computers. Such topics as brain-computer interfaces and human-robot interaction interest me. The topic of my Ph.D. will focus specifically on curiosity and its application in the robotics field.

# Previous Projects
**May 2016 - July 2016**
_Department of Otorhinolaryngology (Audiology), University Medical Centre Groningen_
* Conducted psychoacoustic experiment on voice perception with cochlear implant (CI) and hearing aid simulations. Results show a bimodal hearing benefit which is limited to fundamental frequency perception. The study is currently being written up for publication.


**October 2016 - May 2016**
_Department of Experimental Psychology, University of Groningen_
* Developed and pilot tested an electroencephalography (EEG) based neurofeedback system for improving speech perception in CI users. Results indicate a necessity for further research on event-related potentials, specifically the P300 waveform, elicited by non-word, vocoded speech stimuli.


**April 2015 - December 2015**
_Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Engineering, University of Groningen_
*EEG study on theta oscillation phase-locking after attentional blink (AB) training. After training away the AB, no significant increase found in theta oscillation phase-locking.
