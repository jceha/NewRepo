# Research
## Interests
<<<<<<< HEAD
My research interests lie in the advancement of the cognitive neuroscience and human-machine interaction fields. Intruiged by cognition and by increasing our understanding of it, I would like to apply that knowledge to improving the communcation between humans and computers.

I am fascinated by brain-computer interfaces and human-robot interaction. The focus of my Ph.D. is currently on curiosity and its application to educational social robotics.

# Previous Projects
## Psychoacoustic Experiment on Voice Perception
### Department of Otorhinolaryngology (Audiology), University Medical Centre Groningen
_Speech Perception Lab - Dr. Deniz Baskent (co-supervisor: Dr. Marieke van Vugt)_ 
- Psychoacoustic experiment on voice perception with cochlear implant (CI) and hearing aid simulations. Results show a bimodal hearing benefit which is limited to fundamental frequency perception. The study is currently being written up for publication.

## EEG-based Neurofeedback System (Brain-Computer Interface)
### Department of Experimental Psychology, University of Groningen
_Belief, Perception, and Cognition Lab - Dr. Jacob Jolij (co-supervisors: Dr. Deniz Baskent & Dr. Marieke van Vugt)_ 
- Developed and pilot tested an electroencephalography (EEG) based neurofeedback system for improving speech perception in CI users. Results indicate a necessity for further research on event-related potentials, specifically the P300 waveform, elicited by non-word, vocoded speech stimuli.

## EEG study on Theta Oscillation Phase-Locking
### Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Engineering, University of Groningen
_Cognitive Modelling Group - Dr. Marieke van Vugt_ 
- EEG study on theta oscillation phase-locking after attentional blink (AB) training. After training away the AB, no significant increase found in theta oscillation phase-locking.
