# About
- Fall 2017, Ph.D. in the David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science at the University of Waterloo, working in the Human-Computer Interaction Lab with Professor Dr. Edith Law.

- July 2016, graduated _cum laude_ from the University of Groningen with an M.Sc. in Human-Machine Communication 

- 2014-2016, alongside M.Sc. completed the Honours Master ‘High Tech Systems and Materials’ at the University of Groningen for which I interned at Philips Consumer Lifestyle in Drachten, and for the Master Work co-developed and built an electromyography directed 3D-printed robotic hand

- May 2014 graduated from the University of British Columbia with a B.Sc. in Cognitive Systems: Cognition and Brain


# Research
## Interests
My main research interests lie in the advancement of the cognitive neuroscience and human-machine interaction fields. I am intruiged by cognition and by increasing our understanding of it I would like to apply that knowledge to improving the communcation between humans and computers.

Such topics as brain-computer interfaces and human-robot interaction interest me. The focus of my Ph.D. will be on curiosity and its application to robotics.

# Previous Projects
## Psychoacoustic Experiment on Voice Perception
### _Department of Otorhinolaryngology (Audiology), University Medical Centre Groningen_ [May 2016 - July 2016]
_Speech Perception Lab - Dr. Deniz Baskent (co-supervisor: Dr. Marieke van Vugt)_ 
- Psychoacoustic experiment on voice perception with cochlear implant (CI) and hearing aid simulations. Results show a bimodal hearing benefit which is limited to fundamental frequency perception. The study is currently being written up for publication.

## EEG-based Neurofeedback System (Brain-Computer Interface)
### _Department of Experimental Psychology, University of Groningen_ [October 2015 - May 2016]
_Belief, Perception, and Cognition Lab - Dr. Jacob Jolij (co-supervisors: Dr. Deniz Baskent & Dr. Marieke van Vugt)_ 
- Developed and pilot tested an electroencephalography (EEG) based neurofeedback system for improving speech perception in CI users. Results indicate a necessity for further research on event-related potentials, specifically the P300 waveform, elicited by non-word, vocoded speech stimuli.

## EEG study on Theta Oscillation Phase-Locking
### _Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Engineering, University of Groningen_ [April 2015 - December 2015]
_Cognitive Modelling Group - Dr. Marieke van Vugt_ 
- EEG study on theta oscillation phase-locking after attentional blink (AB) training. After training away the AB, no significant increase found in theta oscillation phase-locking.
