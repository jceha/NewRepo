# About
I will start a Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of Waterloo in the Fall of 2017, working in the Human-Computer Interaction Lab with Professor Dr. Edith Law. In 2016 I graduated with an M.Sc. in Human-Machine Communication from the Univeristy of Groningen and I have a B.Sc. in Cognitive Systems: Cognition and Brain from the University of British Columbia. Alongside the normal master, I also completed the Honours Master 'High Tech Systems and Materials' for which I interned at Philips Consumer Lifestyle in Drachten.


# Research
## Summary
My main interests lie in the advancement of the neuroscience and human-machine interaction fields. I am intruiged by cognition and by increasing our understanding of it I would like to apply that knowledge to improving the communcation between humans and computers. Such topics as brain-computer interfaces and human-robot interaction interest me. The focus of my Ph.D. will be on curiosity and its application to robotics.

# Previous Projects
## Psychoacoustic Experiment on Voice Perception
**May 2016 - July 2016**
_Department of Otorhinolaryngology (Audiology), University Medical Centre Groningen_
Conducted psychoacoustic experiment on voice perception with cochlear implant (CI) and hearing aid simulations. Results show a bimodal hearing benefit which is limited to fundamental frequency perception. The study is currently being written up for publication.

## EEG-based Neurofeedback System (Brain-Computer Interface)
**October 2015 - May 2016**
_Department of Experimental Psychology, University of Groningen_
Developed and pilot tested an electroencephalography (EEG) based neurofeedback system for improving speech perception in CI users. Results indicate a necessity for further research on event-related potentials, specifically the P300 waveform, elicited by non-word, vocoded speech stimuli.

## EEG study on Theta Oscillation Phase-Locking
**April 2015 - December 2015**
_Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Engineering, University of Groningen_
EEG study on theta oscillation phase-locking after attentional blink (AB) training. After training away the AB, no significant increase found in theta oscillation phase-locking.
